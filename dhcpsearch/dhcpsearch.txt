DHCP configurations reside in /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.hosts.conf that
is included by dhcpd.conf itself.

Scripts here will help to generate dhcpd.hosts.conf.
Remember to always restart dhcpd after modifying
the configuration files.

Case 1: Clean config
====================

Boot up nodes and let them query for DHCP address. The
queries will be logged in syslog and can be searched by

	./dhcplog2db.sh > hosts.db

hosts.db will now have one line per each node asking
for an IP. Modify the file (change IP address and host 
name), after which you can generate the dhcpd.hosts.conf:

	./db2dhcpconf.sh hosts.db > /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.hosts.conf 


Case 2: New hosts + Existing hosts in DHCP config
=================================================

Create a new db that includes also the old entries
from DHCP configuration, by

	./dhcplog2db.sh > hosts.db

Again, modify hosts.db and run
	
	./db2dhcpconf.sh hosts.db > /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.hosts.conf 

Case 3: New hosts + existing DB + existing DHCP config
======================================================

If you already have entries in hosts.db that you want
to keep, bu also want to look for new machines, call
the lookup with the existing db as an argument:

	./dhcplog2db.sh hosts.db > hosts.new.db

(do not overwrite the old db at this point). Now you
can again modify the hosts.new.db and then run

	./db2dhcpconf.sh hosts.new.db > /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.hosts.conf 


Manually editing dhcpd.hosts.conf
=================================

Keep each host definition on one line.
